## What is this?
Reminderer is a .NET WPF application with repeating alarm and timer features. 

It was a personal project I took on during the time I had off between being discharged from my service and getting back to school. 

I wanted to have something that can send me alarms on my desktop and not on my phone. Decided to just put something together myself for fun.
