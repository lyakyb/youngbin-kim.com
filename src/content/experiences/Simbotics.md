## What is this?
Simbotics is a high school Robotics team with team number 1114 competing in FIRST Robotics Competition, FRC in short.

Students and mentors are given 6 weeks to design, build and program a fully functioing robot that can compete in each year's game which is announced in January. 

I was a member of the team from Grade 11 to 12, then returned as a mentor upon graudation. Mainly contributed in programming subteam. 

We use Java to program. 

We used a number of cool stuff to control the robot, including basic sensors such as potentiometers, encoders, gyrometers, switches, solenoids , Microsoft Kinect, and webcam. Used a bit of OpenCV here and there when working with camera for vision tracking.
