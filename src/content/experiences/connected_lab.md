#### What I did
Worked as a software developer co-op. Initially started working on an existing iOS application to gain familiarity with iOS platform. 

After having some exposure to iOS, was put into experimenting Xamarin as a new Android/iOS cross-platform solution. 

Then following the announcement of tvOS from Apple, started developing a tvOS/iOS companion application which used Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as the communication method between the devices. 

As the term moves towards the end, worked on a POC project in a combination of Amazon Alexa, iOS app and simple arduino hardware. 

Some additional works include working on clientâ€™s iOS library to fix memory leaks and bugs, and writing an iOS websocket library in objective C.
