## What is this?
HelpYouDecide is an iOS application that helps make decisions for the user. 

A user can input their possible options, the app will pick one option for the user.

I decided to create this application after having gone through mulitple occassions of not being able to decide on what to eat or where to go when I met up with my friends. 

We would all just meet up without specific purpose, everyone would have a few ideas on what they want to do/eat but not strongly set for one. So we would waste minimum half an hour just wandering around. It was about time we put end to it. 

I originally thought to put this up on Appstore, however I was still doing my military service when I developed this application and during my service my Apple Developer account expired and I have not found the time to polish this yet :P.
