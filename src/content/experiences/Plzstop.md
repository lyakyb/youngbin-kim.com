## What is this?
Plzstop is a Chrome Extension that blocks users from accessing certain websites (on user's demand lol).

After the first couple of weeks of being back in school, I realized that when I have my computer on for studying (PDFs, googling and whatnot), I ended up going on certain websites to just slack off quite frequently. 

I knew that I could just not go on them or download an existing app that does what Plzstop does (and definitely better and sexier too), but thought to why not just create a simple Chrome extension for fun. I always wanted to create some kind of an extension on my own anyway. 

The only problem was that I couldn't really find the time to make it. So I decided to keep putting in a bit of work during breaks between lectures and quickly hack something together so I can use it ASAP.

Took me about 3 days worth of lecture breaks and a couple hours (yay cancelled lectures bb), I finally have something functional that I had in mind. 

Next time I work on a Chrome Extension, I want to try and build it with a modern framework. Maybe React or Vue.
