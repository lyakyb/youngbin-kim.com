#### What I did
Initial work began with fixing small low impact bugs on production to gain familiarity with all the projects. 

After gaining familiarity, I was given more high impact JIRA cards. 

Automated ledger syncing process which a finance person had been doing manual work for 15 currencies on a daily basis by adding an integration with Stripe Webhook events.

As I understood our product and projects better and better, I helped out clients(end-users) with issues which can be caused by user mistake, our mistake or bad data. After resolving the issue for the client, I went back to our project to ensure that the sort of bad data that caused the bug cannot be introduced into our DB. 

Also worked on implementing a new feature that got lost during co-op student transition before and only had the initial stage of the feature implemented. The feature was to allow users to generate a csv report from PostgreSQL DB to their needs (i.e. filtering) and to be emailed to the user on the days they desire.
