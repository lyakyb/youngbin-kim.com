#### What I did
Worked as a software developer intern in a dev team of 6. Main job was to develop and maintain Windows applications for internal use of the company. Applications were developed in C#, .NET WPF framework. 

Daily stand ups in the morning, tech-debt Tuesdays where we address and devote the entire day to work on tech-debts from the past. 

Development process followed Test Driven Development (TDD) which utilized nunit as a testing framework. Some of the tools we leveraged include Teamcity for CI/CD and Jetbrainâ€™s extension products.
