#### What I did
Served my mandatory military duty as a South Korean for 21 months. 

During basic military training, I applied and was drafted as an Assist Drill Sergeant, which is basically equivalent of an Drill Sergeant but drafted from conscripted soldiers. 

Taught 10 classes of soldiers with their basic training;
- CBR Training
- CPR 
- How to shoot and manage a rifle
- How to throw grenades
- How to handle injuries under combat
- How to walk and dress as a soldier
- How to fold clothes to fit in their locker

Each class was about 200 people on average, totalling up to 2,000 soldiers. Had the opportunity to meet and teach all kinds of different people from all over the country. 

Learned a lot of personal skills during my time.
